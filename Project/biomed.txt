"As biomedical information in the form of publications and electronic health records (EHR) increases at an increasingly fast pace there is clear utility in having systems that can automatically handle information extraction summarization and question answering tasks. While there have been signiﬁcant strides in improving language tasks for general language addressing domain-speciﬁc contexts still remains challenging. In this project I apply and ﬁne-tune models to the SQuAD dataset and further modify/adapt for biomedical domain-speciﬁc question answering. I evaluated and compared performance on the SQuAD dataset and BioASQ, a biomedical literature QA dataset, with the goal of analyzing and developing approaches to leverage unsupervised language models for domain-speciﬁc applications. Uponbgenerating various ﬁne-tuned models the best performance for general language SQuAD QA achieved score of 76 EM score of 73 and for biomedical-speciﬁc"
